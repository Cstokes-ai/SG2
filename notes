# The SG2 project for CS 4500 (Spring 2025) is a team-based assignment
# where students develop a program to process and validate CSV files
# containing species abundance data.
# The program prompts the user for a file, ensures it exists with a valid .csv
# extension, and verifies that dates and abundance counts meet specified criteria.
# Errors trigger detailed messages before termination.
# Extracted species names and dates are saved in separate files, while abundance
# data is converted into a binary presence/absence format.
# The program also identifies maximum abundance values per date and groups
# dates with identical presence patterns.
# Teams must log daily communication via email, and the final submission
# includes source code, a design document, and a test plan.
# This project emphasizes data validation, structured reporting,
# software reuse, and collaboration.
